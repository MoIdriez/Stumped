			<h3><a href="http://www.limbless-association.org/index.php/information/volunteer-visitors">Limbless Association Charity</a></h3>
			<p>Limbless Associationâ€™s Volunteer Visitor (VV) Network offers a free service to the amputee community.  The VVs are all Limbless Association members who are willing to share their experience of limb-loss and knowledge and understanding with anyone who has had, or is about to have an amputation.  By offering their acquired empathy and understanding, based on their own personal experiences and knowledge, VVs have insightful practical information and suggestions on the everyday issues you may be facing.</p>
			<p>Limbless Association can find a volunteer to visit you at home, or in hospital, for a face-to-face meeting or for a telephone conversation.  They will try to match your request with the most suitable volunteer by using, as far as possible, the following criteria:
			<br>&#9679; level of limb-loss
			<br>&#9679; geographical area
			<br>&#9679; gender
			<br>&#9679; reason for limb-loss; and
			<br>&#9679; age</p>
			<p>Limbless Association can also try to find a volunteer who has specific knowledge of an area of interest that you would like to learn more about, such as a sport you would like to return to or a hobby you may wish to take up.</p>
			<p>Since the VVs are not trained medical professionals or counsellors, they cannot provide specific medical, psychological or legal advice.  However, they can provide practical and essential information and an empathetic insight and understanding into your situation.</p>
			<p>If you would like to arrange a visit from the VV, please visit Limbless Association website by clicking:</p>
